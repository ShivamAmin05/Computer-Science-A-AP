public class Comments
{
    public static void main (String[] args)
    {
      // counts to five in English
      System.out.println ("one two three four five");
      
      // counts to five in French
      System.out.println ("un deux trois quatre cinq");

      // //counts to five in Spanish
      System.out.println ("uno dos tres cuatro cinco");
    }

/*
2. Add a comment before each println that indicates what language the next line is in. Experiment with leaving a blank line before each of these comment lines (in the program itself, not the output). Is the program easier to read with or without these blank lines?

The program is easier to read with the blank lines

3. Remove one of the slashes from one of your comment lines and recompile the program, so one of the comments starts with a single /. What error do you get? Put the slash back in.

The program returns illegal start of expression and does not compile

4. Try putting a comment within a comment, so that a // appears after the initial // on a comment line. Does this cause problems?

This does not cause a problem
